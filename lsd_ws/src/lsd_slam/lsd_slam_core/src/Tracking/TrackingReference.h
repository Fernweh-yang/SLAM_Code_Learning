 * Point cloud used to track frame poses.

 * Basically this stores a point cloud generated from known frames. It is used to
 * track a new frame by finding a projection of the point cloud which makes it
 * look as much like the new frame as possible.
 *
 * It is intended to use more than one old frame as source for the point cloud.
 * Also other data like Kinect depth data could be imported.
 *
 * ATTENTION: as the level zero point cloud is not used for tracking, it is not
 * fully calculated. Only the weights are valid on this level!
